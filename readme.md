# Library Management System

## Project Description
This project is a Library Management System implemented using different programming paradigms including Event-Driven, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Procedural approaches. It aims to provide a comprehensive solution for managing library operations such as book lending, returns, and inventory management.

## Features
- Manage books and their details
- Track book lending and returns
- Support for multiple programming paradigms
- Modular and extensible design

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired implementation folder:
   - `Library_Management_System_(EVEN_DRIVEN)`
   - `Library_Management_System_(OOP)`
   - `Library_Management_System_(PROCEDURAL)`
3. Follow the specific instructions in each implementation folder to run the system.

## Usage
- Each implementation folder contains the source code and instructions to run the Library Management System using the respective programming paradigm.
- Choose the implementation that best suits your learning or project needs.

## Folder Structure
- `flowchart_and_pseusocode/` - Contains flowcharts and pseudocode diagrams for the system design.
- `Library_Management_System_(EVEN_DRIVEN)/` - Event-driven implementation of the Library Management System.
- `Library_Management_System_(OOP)/` - Object-Oriented Programming implementation.
- `Library_Management_System_(PROCEDURAL)/` - Procedural programming implementation.
